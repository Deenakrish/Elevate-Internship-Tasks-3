After reviewing the Nessus vulnerability scan report, the identified issues were analyzed based on their severity and potential impact. 

Five vulnerabilities were selected for further research, and simple mitigation steps were documented for each:
Python Brotli ≤1.1.0 DoS – Updated to the latest version to prevent denial-of-service attacks caused by malformed compressed input.
PostgreSQL Multiple Issues – Updated PostgreSQL, restricted unnecessary network access, and strengthened authentication mechanisms.
Ruby REXML DoS – Upgraded Ruby REXML to a patched version to prevent excessive CPU usage triggered by malicious XML input.
SSL/TLS Multiple Issues – Disabled outdated protocols and weak cipher suites, enforcing secure TLS configurations.
SSH Multiple Issues – Hardened SSH by disabling root login, removing weak ciphers, and restricting insecure authentication methods.

Overall, these mitigation steps significantly reduce risks related to denial-of-service, information disclosure, weak encryption, and misconfigurations, thereby improving the security posture of the system.
